💡 **Personal Insight**  
When I’m not training models or debugging code, you’ll find me lost in deep thoughts — probably over a hot cup of **Chaye ☕**, the official drink of machine learning.  
I enjoy solving problems independently, always striving to find the best solution.

🧠 *"Learning AI is not about knowing everything — it's about solving real problems, one step at a time."*
