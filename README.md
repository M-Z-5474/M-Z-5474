### 💡 Personal Insight

When I’m not training models or debugging code, you’ll find me lost in deep thoughts — probably over a hot cup of **Chaye ☕**, the official drink of machine learning (at least in my world).  
I enjoy solving problems, always striving to find the best possible solution.

🧠 *"Learning AI is not about knowing everything — it's about solving real problems, one step at a time."*
